I just don't seem to care enough about anything, nothing seems to be worth my effort. I have no passions or liking to things, I just sit there on my computer all day/TV. \\n\\nMost days I see no reason to get up or do anything healthy/productive. It's quite a nihilistic out view I have. I must say, I'm quite optimistic. As contradictory as that sounds I always look on the bright side of things, as it always bodes a better result.\\n\\nAm I extremely lazy or depressed? I sure feel down most of the time, when I'm with friends it's okay, but it's not like any of my laughs or smiles are genuine however; I feel emotionless most of the time. This has been going on for at least a year or two and I really need to get work done and get on with my life so I don't fall behind. Any help would be appreciated :)\",\n          \"I've been realizing some damn hard truths about myself. I've never been happy, ever since I was a little kid I felt like I was \\\"bad\\\". You know how children play \\\"house\\\" and it can be used in therapy to evaluate their outlook and issues? When I was a kid, I would play \\\"house\\\" with my fingers: there was the mom, dad, brother, and sister (me, the pinky finger). Each time, everyone would gang up on and beat up the sister. I just remembered that I used to \\\"play\\\" that game the other day - I don't think I have any real excuse for that, I was anxious as hell from a young age and irritable as fuck, but what kind of kid thinks of that shit? I was messed up back then.\\n\\n\\nI've talked to professionals. They seem to think that this is more than anxiety and depression. They say that I've faced a lot of trauma in my life. I suppose it makes sense. My parents were heavily abused during their childhoods, my mom even tried to kill herself as a young kid. My dad was an abusive alcoholic for most of my childhood. He and my mom would fight a lot - they would swear at each other, he would hit and throw things at her, she would scream at him and they would usually tell each other to go to Hell or drop dead. My dad was verbally abusive, and I remember he would hit my brother too. I presume he hit me, but I don't remember. All I remember is that when I was a teenager, he got so angry at me that he held me down on the couch. I was so detached, all I thought was how he was so angry he was about to drool on me, and how it was gross. I love my parents, despite their flaws. I just don't like them. We fight all the time. When I was younger, I remember that often when I got into a row with one parent, the other would get involved and then they would fight with each other. They would say horrible things like what I said above. They would say awful things to me too, like how once I was mad and my mom said I should look in the mirror to see how ugly I look. She would tell me to \\\"get out of her sight\\\" a lot. I get called a bitch at times. I'm told I treat them horrible, and I hate myself even more when they say that. Ugh. On the note of trauma, I realized earlier this year that I was repeatedly raped (oral, not vaginal) by my ex over the course of a year or so. That's also been tough to process.\\n\\nIt's fucked because I know my parents love me. They read to me as a child, they taught me to be independent. They just want me to be happy. But there's just always been something missing, I guess.\\n\\nI realized that I may be in a chronic state of mild dissociation. I often feel detached from my body, my emotions, my environment, other people. I feel like I'm in a fog. My limbs aren't quite attached to my body, I feel floaty or dizzy. Weak and shaky. At times I dissociate harder, and I go totally numb. Can't move. Can't talk. Things look smaller, I float above or behind my body. My vision gets weird. It's scary yet comfortable because I'm aware that I'm further detached from myself and in a limbo for an hour. It fades and I get a headache, my body hurts, and I'm exhausted. Then it's back to reality, and I feel even more off for the rest of the day. I've noticed I also mildly dissociate when I try to sleep. My head is disconnected from my body, my limbs feel large or disconnect from my body. It's incredibly disturbing and I don't know why it happens. I never even realized I apparently dissociate until I started thinking about my childhood. Experienced some crazy depersonalization and derealization. When it happened, I realized that it was *very* familiar and I remembered doing it a lot as a kid. That realization fucked me up.\\n\\n\\nWhat really makes me feel crazy is the apparent somatic symptoms. I developed chronic visual snow and headaches as a teenager. I also started getting ocular migraines. Numerous tests and exams showed that all is well - it's just stress. My mouth has been hurting for the past year, as well. I even got an extra wisdom tooth removed, thinking that was the source of the pain. Nope. The pain persists, and is very noticeable when I'm stressed. Xrays and exams show that things are fine. I feel like a damn hypochondriac or like I'm malingering...but this is all very real to me.\\n\\n\\nI feel weak a lot. I am also dizzy, or like my brain is rotting, or stuffed with cotton/fog. My head is never \\\"clear\\\". I can't focus on much. Working is difficult. I can't truly interact with friends or family anymore. My weight has been all over. Due to horrible anxiety, I had lost a third of my body weight in 9 months. When I fell into this double depression, I lost 14 pounds in 2 weeks. Then someone I care about confronted me about the seriousness of it all. I tried to maintain my weight, and it worked for a month. Then I had a little breakdown and lost 7 pounds in 5 days. Started an antidepressant and became apathetic as hell - had an aborted suicide attempt and binge ate like crazy even though I wasn't hungry. I was like \\\"fuck it I deserve to gain weight and look disgusting\\\". I've gained 10 pounds in a week. I hate myself so much.\\n\\n\\nThe more I realize, the more I hate myself. I've tried six or seven antidepressants, I've tried therapy a few times and am trying again. On another med right now. It all feels so damn hopeless. I've wanted to die since I was 13, and every day is just full of more pain and despair. \\n\\n\\nPeople tell me not to give up on myself, but it gets more and more tempting as time goes on. Ever since I was 15, I always had a strong feeling I would die by suicide. I figured I wouldn't kill myself until I was 27 or 28, but things are becoming more disasterous. I just wish I had the courage to end this suffering soon. I feel like such a disgusting coward and a fraud. I'm ashamed to exist, to take up space in this world.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"data"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-b872ebb4-2792-4b92-a17d-a3625651b03f\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>is_suicide</th>\n","      <th>selftext</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Hi I don't really know how to phrase this situation but I'll try. My life is at a really good point right now, I'm never really depressed over stuff and 99 percent of the time my mind is clear. I'm about to graduate high school and I'm really excited. However, people in my family and friend group have tons of issues. Wether they sleep all day, hate themselves, or have no ambition to keep living on in this world, they've got problems. I don't wanna sound like I'm gloating, but usually I'm the person that a lot of these people end up going to because usually I'm able to talk people through issues and help them in the long run. Yeah sometimes their issues make me really sad and stuff because who doesn't feel sad when people are telling you they feel worthless.\\n\\nBut today one of my best friends showed me that he was cutting and it really effected me. I talked to him about it and it's mostly because of how painfully \"bored\" he is and he doesn't even know why he's doing it (he's a pretty logical guy). He will go to class and just sit there for and hour most of the time doing nothing challenging because that's the way our school works. He has clinically diagnosed depression, has been to a psychiatric ward, and sees a therapist regularly. It's only been a couple hours since he showed me his arm, and I didn't even see all of it. \\n\\nI've got two main problems right now. First I don't really know how to help him. He said literally the only thing I can really do is just hang out with him after school and on the weekends so he doesn't just sit in bed all day. I've been trying to make an effort to do that as much as I can but I need to do more. He said himself that as long as he goes to highschool, and considering it's the law, he's going to feel this way until we graduate. I just need to know something I can do to help him, do I tell his parents? A therapist won't help he already goes to one. Should I talk to him more about it tomorrow. I just don't know\\n\\nSecond, stuff like this is really effecting me. I just feel that the world is being unfair to everyone I care about and I just want everyone I love to feel better. As of lately I've been feeling depressed whenever my friends need to talk about issues and it's really weighing down on me. I just don't want to leave the people I care about down in the dirt. \\n\\nSo yeah if anyone has any advice whatsoever please help me. Im normally able to deal with these feelings and help my friends but right now I'm struggling.

My life is at a really good point right now, I'm never really depressed over stuff and 99 percent of the time my mind is clear. I'm about to graduate high school and I'm really excited. However, people in my family and friend group have tons of issues. Wether they sleep all day, hate themselves, or have no ambition to keep living on in this world, they've got problems. I don't wanna sound like I'm gloating, but usually I'm the person that a lot of these people end up going to because usually I'm able to talk people through issues and help them in the long run. Yeah sometimes their issues make me really sad and stuff because who doesn't feel sad when people are telling you they feel worthless.\\n\\nBut today one of my best friends showed me that he was cutting and it really effected me. I talked to him about it and it's mostly because of how painfully \"bored\" he is and he doesn't even know why he's doing it (he's a pretty logical guy). He will go to class and just sit there for and hour most of the time doing nothing challenging because that's the way our school works. He has clinically diagnosed depression, has been to a psychiatric ward, and sees a therapist regularly. It's only been a couple hours since he showed me his arm, and I didn't even see all of it. \\n\\nI've got two main problems right now. First I don't really know how to help him. He said literally the only thing I can really do is just hang out with him after school and on the weekends so he doesn't just sit in bed all day. I've been trying to make an effort to do that as much as I can but I need to do more. He said himself that as long as he goes to highschool, and considering it's the law, he's going to feel this way until we graduate. I just need to know something I can do to help him, do I tell his parents? A therapist won't help he already goes to one. Should I talk to him more about it tomorrow. I just don't know\\n\\nSecond, stuff like this is really effecting me. I just feel that the world is being unfair to everyone I care about and I just want everyone I love to feel better. As of lately I've been feeling depressed whenever my friends need to talk about issues and it's really weighing down on me. I just don't want to leave the people I care about down in the dirt. \\n\\nSo yeah if anyone has any advice whatsoever please help me. Im normally able to deal with these feelings and help my friends but right now I'm struggling.

My life is at really good point right now , never really depressed over stuff and percent of the time my mind is clear . about to graduate high school and really excited . However , people in my family and friend group have tons of issues . Wether they sleep all day , hate themselves , or have no ambition to keep living on in this world , they ve got problems . don wan na sound like gloating , but usually the person that lot of these people end up going to because usually able to talk people through issues and help them in the long run . Yeah sometimes their issues make me really sad and stuff because who doesn feel sad when people are telling you they feel worthless . But today one of my best friends showed me that he was cutting and it really effected me . talked to him about it and it mostly because of how painfully bored he is and he doesn even know why he doing it he pretty logical guy . He will go to class and just sit there for and hour most of the time doing nothing challenging because that the way our school works . He has clinically diagnosed depression , has been to psychiatric ward , and sees therapist regularly . It only been couple hours since he showed me his arm , and didn even see all of it . ve got two main problems right now . First don really know how to help him . He said literally the only thing can really do is just hang out with him after school and on the weekends so he doesn just sit in bed all day . ve been trying to make an effort to do that as much as can but need to do more . He said himself that as long as he goes to highschool , and considering it the law , he going to feel this way until we graduate . just need to know something can do to help him , do tell his parents ? therapist won help he already goes to one . Should talk to him more about it tomorrow . just don know Second , stuff like this is really effecting me . just feel that the world is being unfair to everyone care about and just want everyone love to feel better . As of lately ve been feeling depressed whenever my friends need to talk about issues and it really weighing down on me . just don want to leave the people care about down in the dirt . So yeah if anyone has any advice whatsoever please help me . Im normally able to deal with these feelings and help my friends but right now struggling . Thank you   \n","1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           have been so depressed these past couple weeks ever since got back from vacation normal life and reality has hit me and its terrible . im havent moved out yet dont really have sufficient job have one but its not enough money for me to support myself . at least have car and im taking online classes so . feel stuck in this stupid fucking town . empty and alone man just want someone to love me dude but im ugly and fat and worthless and no one is ever going to see im worth the chance . its just one thing after another to worry about . why not end it now before really fuck up and become miserable ? dont see the point in going on im just really down right now dont know what to do all there is darkness idk how to get out of this hole hate myself hate my body hate my life dont think it will ever get better   \n","\n","   label  \n","0      0  \n","1      1  "]},"execution_count":8,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Drop Missing\n","data = data.dropna(axis=\"index\", subset=[\"is_suicide\", \"selftext_clean\"]).reset_index(\n","    drop=True\n",")\n","data = data[[\"selftext_clean\", \"is_suicide\"]]\n","data.columns = [\"text\", \"label\"]\n","data.head(2)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CoDBvCOPDT1K"},"source":["### A brief background on transformers and BERT\n","\n","Transformer models, similar to RNNs (e.g. the LSTM ), are designed to handle sequences of data well. They shine at picking up relations between various inputs in an input sequence. Hence, they lend themselves perfectly for NLP tasks where such associations correspond to semantic relationships. This is also a convenient property of LSTM models, e.g. the one we implemented previously. It was able to learn relationships between sequences of the input, e.g. word vectors. For LSTMs, however, this ability is limited. Because inputs are processed in sequence, in practice, at the end of a long sentence information from the beginning will often be lost. Also, computational limits come into play really quick for the same reason. Transformer models address this issue by using the so called `attention` mechanism. This allows them to process inputs in a non sequential way which allows for better parallelization. Following, computational efficiency is greatly improved. In addition, they learn associations between words even if those are far apart in a sentence. This is an outstanding improvement when trying to model language. It explains why transformers are at the foundation of most state of the art models and why they have surpassed former architectures like LSTMs.\n","\n","BERT has been developed by Google and has set new records on several language related tasks. Its main novelty is the introduction of bi-directionality. Previous models looked at inputs uni directionally, i.e. from left to right. In contrast, BERT also looks at them from right to left. The authors have proved that this leads to a deeper understanding of context in texts and increases performance significantly.  \n","As most other state of the art models, a lot of BERT's performance comes from sheer size. BERT large (24 layers, 16 attention heads, 340 million parameters) is trained on a huge text dataset in order to gain a thorough understanding of language in general. For this, it follows several ingenious unsupervised training strategies. Training such models is extremely computationally demanding and expensive.   \n","Fortunately, we can apply the principle of transfer learning to such models. That is, we can fine tune a pre trained model on a more specific task and dataset (which doesn't need to be that huge). In our case, we will simply add a classification layer to the pre trained BERT model. Then, we will do a supervised training on our labeled dataset. Consequently, we will mainly train our classifier layer while most other layers will only be minimally impacted. In a sense, we use the general language understanding of the pre trained model and improve its understanding of our unique domain. Moreover, we teach it to solve a specific task. In our case, this will be sentiment analysis in the form of a binary text classification."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bRP_b3_6vnk3"},"source":["### Feture Creation and Modeling\n","\n","As mentioned before, we use the [`transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library.

Another invaluable advantage of the transformers library, is that several pre trained models are readily available for usage.  \n","BERT comes with its own Tokenizer.
